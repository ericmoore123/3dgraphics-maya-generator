- There are 2 sub folder:
	- ForestModels: contains all the models
	- ForestGenerationTool_Code: contains the code, Read me text and video demo how to use the too

- Copy and paste the path into the text field
	*If the models aren't in the right path the tool will not work properly*

-All models used need to be saved using the full version of maya (NOT STUDENT VERSION).

- Take the python file and put it into Maya code editor and run to call the tool UI.
